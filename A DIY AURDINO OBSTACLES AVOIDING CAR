(A DIY AURDINO OBSTATE AVOIDING CAR

In an environment where autonomous navigation is essential, such as robotics or automated vehicles,
one key challenge is ensuring safe movement without human intervention. Cars or robots need to detect 
and avoid obstacles efficiently to prevent collisions and damage to both the environment and the 
vehicle. This project aims to solve this problem by developing a low-cost, automatic obstacle-avoiding 
car using an Arduino Uno as the microcontroller.
