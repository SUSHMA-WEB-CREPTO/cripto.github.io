[Objective-]

The main objective of this project is to build a fully autonomous vehicle that can detect and avoid 
obstacles in its path. The car will navigate without manual control, continuously sensing its 
surroundings using an ultrasonic sensor to avoid collisions, thereby demonstrating simple autonomous 
driving concepts

[Given solution-]

To achieve automatic obstacle avoidance, an Arduino Uno is programmed to process input from an 
ultrasonic sensor, which detects obstacles by measuring the distance to nearby objects. When an 
obstacle is detected within a specified range, the carâ€™s motors and wheels are controlled to change 
direction and avoid the obstacle. This system allows the vehicle to navigate dynamically in real
