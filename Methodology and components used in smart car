[Methodology-]

1.Sensing: The ultrasonic sensor is mounted at the front of the car and connected to the Arduino Uno 
to detect obstacles by measuring the distance to objects in the car’s path.
2.Processing: The Arduino processes the input data from the sensor and determines the appropriate 
response (e.g., stop, turn left, turn right) based on the distance measured.
3.Control: The motor driver shield, connected to the Arduino, controls the movement of the car’s wheels 
through the attached TT gear motors, ensuring the car can move forward, backward, or change direction 
when needed.
4.Power Supply: A pair of 18650 Li-ion batteries provide power to the Arduino and motors.
